# C++ Projects Repository

Welcome to the **C++ Projects Repository**! This collection features various C++ projects that demonstrate key programming concepts, design patterns, and principles. Each project is organized by its functionality and serves as an educational resource for developers looking to learn or enhance their C++ skills.

## Table of Contents

### Solid Principles

| Principle                               | Description | File Path |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job. | [srp.cpp](c:\c++\Solid Principle\srp.cpp) |
| **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**          | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. | [open-close.cpp](c:\c++\Solid Principle\open-close.cpp) |
| **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  | Objects of a subclass should be replaceable with objects of the superclass without affecting the correctness of the program. | [liskov's.cpp](c:\c++\Solid Principle\liskov's.cpp) |
| **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**| Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. | [interface-segregation.cpp](c:\c++\Solid Principle\interface-segregation.cpp) |
| **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. | [dependency-inversion.cpp](c:\c++\Solid Principle\dependency-inversion.cpp) |

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have a C++ compiler** installed on your machine (e.g., g++, clang).
2. **Navigate to the desired project folder**.
3. **Compile the code** using the following command:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
    ```
4. **Run the executable**:
    ```bash
    ./outputname
    ```
